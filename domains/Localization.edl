    D "Localization of application text is often handled/supported by the particular application framework being"
    D "used. This feature domain is not concerned just about that but mostly about adding code to your application"
    D "so that the dynamic content of application can be stored in multiple languages (localized). In order to"
    D "do this it will require that you define specific entities and attributes that are tagged in such a way"
    D "that supporting code can be generated."

    D "### Discussion"

    D "Normally text can be stored in a simple `string` attribute. Of course, text in only one language can be"
    D "stored this way. To expand this to multiple languages you essentially need three other entities:"
    D ""
    D "- An entity that represents human languages. This should be tagged with `language`."
    D ""
    D "- An entity that represents the translation of the content in a specific language. This will contain the"
    D "  the actual localized text. The entity should be tagged with `content:localized` and the attribute of this"
    D "  entity that contains the localized text should be tagged as `content:text`. This entity should also have"
    D "  a `one` relationship with the `language` entity."
    D ""
    D "- An entity that represents the text you want to localize as **content**. The original text attribute is then"
    D "  replaced by a relationship to this content entity. This will allow it to be expanded to multiple languages."
    D "  This entity should be tagged with `content` and have a `many` relationship with the `content:localized`"
    D "  entity."
    D ""
    D "If an application is going to adopt such a localization system then its very likely it will also need"
    D "to support showing content in a user's preferred language. That is, it would be nice if there were methods"
    D "available that would automatically resolve some content to a language that the user has designated as their"
    D "preferred language. To support this, the entity that represents users of the system should be tagged with"
    D "`user` and should have a relationship with the `language` entity that is tagged with `language:preferred`."
    D "Also, for each content field (relationship) that we want to have this ability, we need to define a"
    D "`virtual string` attribute that is tagged with `content` that assigned a tag value of"
    D "the name of the relationship that corresponds to the content. For instance if you have a relationship"
    D "named `summaryContent` then the `virtual string` attribute tag would be `\"content\" = \"summaryContent\"`."
    D "This will ensure code is generated for that `virtual string` attribute to automatically supply the preferred"
    D "language localization for the logged in user."
